## Introduction
This is a basic carousel — created with HTML, SASS/CSS, and jQuery — whose only function is to rotate either left or right, depending on which image a user has clicked.

## Improvements To Make
While the task was only to bring the supplied .PSD to life, there are some functional plusses that could be made to create a _better_ product.  These might be:

* __Infinite Slides__
	* It would be nice — given the context and direction — to further develop a scalable model that wasn't locked into three slides
* __Responsiveness__
	* Allowing the carousel to work within both a tablet and mobile viewport — without being a zoomed-out desktop experience — would be a 'nice to have'
